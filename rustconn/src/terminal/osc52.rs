//! OSC 52 — clipboard offers from the remote side.
//!
//! libvte parses OSC 52 (`ESC ] 52 ; …`) and then does nothing with it: through
//! 0.84 the `XTERM_SET_XSELECTION` handler is a no-op, so a yank in a remote
//! Neovim — or in tmux with `set-clipboard external` — puts the text nowhere.
//! GNOME Terminal and xfce4-terminal inherit the same hole, so this is a VTE
//! limitation and not a RustConn bug. VTE's 4 KiB `VTE_SEQ_STRING_MAX_CAPACITY`
//! is a second ceiling on the way: an OSC string longer than that is dropped
//! before any handler would see it.
//!
//! [`Osc52Filter`] does what VTE will not. It lifts clipboard offers out of the
//! PTY byte stream on the way to `Terminal::feed`, hands the text to the system
//! clipboard, and passes every other byte through untouched.
//!
//! The filter must never disagree with VTE about what a byte means: anything it
//! holds back that VTE would draw is a bug (a prompt that does not show), and
//! anything VTE treats as OSC 52 that the filter misses is a hole (a remote
//! clipboard write). VTE decodes the stream as UTF-8 before parsing it, so the
//! 8-bit C1 controls are accepted here only in that form — `c2 9d` for `OSC`,
//! `c2 9c` for `ST` — and a bare `0x9d`/`0x9c` is just a continuation byte, as
//! in `❯` (`e2 9d af`). `CAN`, `SUB` and the other C1 controls abandon an open
//! string, as they do in VTE, and only what VTE would also wait for (an open
//! string, a lone `ESC` or `c2`) is held at the end of a chunk. Whatever the
//! filter removes is replaced by a single `CAN`, so that nothing it released
//! before the removal can pair with what follows it ([`Osc52Filter`]).
//!
//! Two rules keep that from becoming a remote-controlled write primitive:
//!
//! * **Opt-in.** [`set_enabled`] mirrors `TerminalSettings::allow_osc52_clipboard`
//!   and starts out off, the way [`super::safe_paste`] does for its own flag. A
//!   host that can write the clipboard can aim a pastejacking payload at the
//!   next terminal the user pastes into, so it is the user's call, per install.
//! * **Write-only, one selection.** A `?` payload is a *query* — the terminal is
//!   being asked to send its clipboard back to the application. Answering it
//!   would stream local clipboard contents to a remote, so the sequence is
//!   dropped unanswered and the application falls back to its own timeout. The
//!   `p` (primary) and `s` (select) selections are passed through rather than
//!   half-supported: they are real, and writing them from a remote was not asked
//!   for.
//!
//! ponytail: only the `c` selection and only `ST`/`BEL`-terminated strings are
//! recognised — no DCS tmux passthrough (`ESC P tmux ; …`), which `allow-passthrough
//! on` wraps sequences in. `set-clipboard external`, the documented route, writes
//! OSC 52 straight to the outer tty and needs none of that. Add a DCS state to
//! [`State`] if a real user turns out to need the wrapper.
